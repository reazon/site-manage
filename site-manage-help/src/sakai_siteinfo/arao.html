<h2>Importing material from another site you
own</h2>

 

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a
basic understanding of roles and permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are planning to combine rosters, be sure
to import content into the ultimate parent site before you do
so. Combining rosters does <strong>not</strong> import content (e.g.,
calendar items, assignments, forums, announcements) into the parent
site, and, once rosters have been combined into a parent site, the
course content for the original sites is no longer accessible for
importing.</p>

<p>For any course or <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">project site</a> you create, you can import
content from other sites you own. You can also combine material from
more than one site. To do this:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the destination site, click <strong><code>Site Info</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>At the top of the Site
Info screen, click <strong><code>Import from Site</code></strong>.

<br /><br />

</li><li>Select the box or radio button next to the site that contains the
source material. If you chose to merge data, you can choose more than
one site. If you chose to replace data, you can choose only one
site. Then click <strong><code>Continue</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under the name of the site(s) you selected, check the box next to
each tool that contains your source material. If a box is
grayed out, it means the corresponding tool is not available in that
site. Then click <strong><code>Continue</code></strong>.
</li></ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Items saved as drafts in the source site will
be imported as drafts, which means they are not immediately viewable by
participants. To make them viewable, you must post them. For
instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbk">Posting an assignment previously saved as a draft</a>.</p>

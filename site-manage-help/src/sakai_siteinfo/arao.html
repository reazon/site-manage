<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>. To view a list of permissions
associated with a given role, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=armh">Permissions, roles, and tools</a>. For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and Roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>For any course or <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">project site</a> you create, you can import
content from other sites you own. You can also combine material from
more than one site. To do so, follow these steps:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the destination site, click <strong><code>Site Info</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>At the top of the Site Info screen, click <strong><code>Import from
Site</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Check the box next to the site that contains the source
material. You may choose more than one site. Then, click
<strong><code>Continue</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under the name of the site(s) you selected, check the box next to
each tool that contains your source material. If a box is grayed-out,
it means the corresponding tool is not available in that site. Then,
click <strong><code>Continue</code></strong>.
</li></ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Your newly imported materials are initially
saved as drafts, which means they are not immediately viewable by
participants. To make them viewable, you must post them. For
instructions, see the following documents:</p>

<ul><li><a href="content.hlp?docId=arbk">Posting an assignment previously saved as a draft</a></li><li><a href="content.hlp?docId=arbw">Posting an announcement previously saved as a draft</a></li><li><a href="content.hlp?docId=arau">Posting a discussion topic or reply previously saved as a draft</a></li></ul>
